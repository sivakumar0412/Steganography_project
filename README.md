## Introduction

Steganography helps hide secret messages inside images, making communication more secure. This project allows you to embed and extract hidden messages from images easily.

## Features

- Hide and extract messages in images
- Supports PNG, JPEG, and BMP formats
- Optional password protection for security
- Simple command-line interface

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Install required libraries using:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

## Future Improvements

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Support for audio and video steganography

## Thanks to

Open-source contributors and steganography researchers!
